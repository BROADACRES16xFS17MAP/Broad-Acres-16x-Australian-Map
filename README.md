# Broad-Acres-16x-Australian-Map
An Australian 16x Map for Farming Simulator FS17 - PC Only.


Ladies and Gentleman welcome to Broad Acres. We made it!!

This post is extremely important to give you a guide to troubleshoot and try things before posting your issue on github for us to investigate. Below is a list of things to do before posting your issues so we know they have been eliminated.

Before I start this map has been tested like no other thanks to the tireless efforts of Victor from Spectrum69 Modding as well as Jonny and Ross who have been with me since the first posting the map on facebook. The map has had numerous fixes and changes and we are happy that we have ironed out 99.99% of them. Therefore below information is considerably important.

 1. Please read the manual first.

 2. Please post your log.txt with every error you are facing. No log.txt no help and issue will be deleted. The log tells us all the problems and what you are running at the time. You can find your log.txt in the Farming Simulator2017 folder (were you also import your mods into).

3. Most errors that will now be raised are due to edited mods that aren't constructed well. We ask that you remove all your mods and then retry same issue to see if it generates the same issue.

4. DO NOT run other maps in conjunction with this map. In FS17 other maps will conflict and will cause things to belong in the map that shouldn't. Run your mods and this map alone.

5. This map will require a good PC to run due to its size. It has been tested for lag on smaller PC's and ran ok. If you are experiencing lag its you PC and not the map. This has been tested in great lengths. If you unsure please post your PC specs at the same time.

6. This map is only released on the Broad Acres Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/groups/1201506563300768/.
If you have downloaded the map from any other place, it is a fake and not supported.

7. If you try and edit the map then ask for help. Please don't. We know if its been edited and will not help.

8. Pictures say a thousand words. Please upload a pic with your issue so I can get an idea of what is happening.

9. This map took over 12 months to build and another month to test. I have put a lot of my hard earned time and effort into this map. Please don't take it for your own and please don't ask permission to edit it or upload it. You do not have permission. If you would like to build your own 16x map there is a link on the Broad Acres Facebook Page for an empty working 16x map. Reap the rewards I have in making your own, not claiming other people's work. It destroys the community and doesn't make you a map maker.

10. Please have a good read in this github to see if someone else has already asked the same question./ This will prevent multiple same posts and you can get your answer quicker.

11. Have fun and play hard.
